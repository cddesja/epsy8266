The visualising [Atlantis](http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/) toolbox, `vat`, was created by Christopher David Desjardins at the [Science Institute at the University of Iceland](http://raunvis.hi.is/rhformE.php) as a part of the [EU MareFrame project](http://www.mareframe-fp7.org/) with code contributions from Vidette McGregor at [NIWA](http://www.niwa.co.nz/) and Erla Sturludottir at the [Science Institute at the University of Iceland](http://raunvis.hi.is/rhformE.php).  

`vat` is released under the [GPL v3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and source code is available at [http://github.com/mareframe/vat](http://github.com/mareframe/vat).

At present, `vat` is able to:
- Display within and across box distributions for functional groups by age classes.
- An interactive plot for the various functional groups and tracers in the model.
- Animated spatial biomass plots.
- Disaggregated plots (SN, RN, total numbers, proportion of numbers, length-at-age, and total biomass) by nitrogen or wet weight for the vertebrate functional groups.
- Diet data by predator and by prey.
- Biological summary data.
- Fishing by species and fishery over time.

To start the application, click a tab, e.g. **Functional Groups**, **Spatial Plots**, etc. Then select the functional group you are interested. Some plots have tabs on the left side of the page which can be clicked (e.g. the Interactive Plots tab).
