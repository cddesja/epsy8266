### Goals

The goal of this activity is to help you visualize the shape of the geometric distribution and use simulation to figure out the mean. 

### Instructions

1. Begin in the `Simple random sample` tab. 
	- Click `Draw a new sample?`. 
	- Observe the shape and the center of the distribution.
	- Repeat this 5 - 10 times a) clicking `Draw a new sample?` and b) observing the shape and center of each random draw, until you think you have a grasp on the shape of the distribution and where the center of the distribution is.
	- Then on a piece of paper draw the shape of the distribution and record where you think the center of the distribution is located.

2. Repeat this same process again, but set the `probability of success:` to .25. 
	- What effect did this have on the shape and the center of the distribution?

3. Click the `Means` tab. 
  	- Click `Run the simulation`. This will take 1,000 random samples of a geometric distribution with a sample size of 100 and a probability of success of .50 and then plot each random samples' mean. The red line that is drawn corresponds to the mean of the means. 
  	- Repeat this 5 - 10 times until you think you know what the mean of the means and record this value.

4. Repeat this process again,  but set the `probability of success:` to .25.  
	- Approximately, what is the mean of the means now?


<!-- ### Bonus

You can try set other `probability of success:`, change the `sample size`, and the number of random samples taken (`Number of samples to draw`) -->
