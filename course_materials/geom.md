### Goals

The goal of this activity is to help you visualize the geometric distribution and make a guess as to what the mean of the distribution might be.

### Instructions

1. Begin in the `Simple random sample` tab. Start with the probability of success set at .5. Click `Draw a new sample?`. Repeat this several times. While you're doing this, think about 

- The shape of the distribution

Then change the probability of success to .25 and then to .75.

- What effect does this have on the shape?

2. Move into the `Means` tab. Click `Run the simulation`. This will then take 1,000 draws out of the geometric distribution of size 100 with a probability of .50 and plot their means. The red line corresponds to the mean. 

- What is the mean of this line approximately?

Then change the probability of  success to .25 and then to .75.

- What are the means of these lines now?
