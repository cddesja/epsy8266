## Lab 2
Below is Lab 2. You only need the PDF version to complete the lab assignment. However, I have stripped all the R code from the PDF to help you complete the assignment. I would encourage you to begin with the PDF and remember you should be able to copy/paste R code between the PDF to RStudio. Because of the was this was document was recreated, I could export it to Word or RMarkdown.

## Lab 1
Below is Lab 1. I have uploaded it in three different formats. One is Word, one is PDF, and one is an RMarkdown file. All the files are the same, however, the RMarkdown file is the raw source code for the Word and PDF versions. I recommend downloading the Word or PDF versions as they are easier to read and if you want to use RMarkdown, feel free to download that one, too. All R code is contained within each of these documents.
