# Computer Labs

## Lab 1
Below is Lab 1. I have uploaded it in three different formats. One is Word, one is PDF, and one is an RMarkdown file. All the files are the same, however, the RMarkdown file is the raw source code for the Word and PDF versions. I recommend downloading the Word or PDF versions as they are easier to read and if you want to use RMarkdown, feel free to download that one, too. All R code is contained within each of these documents.
